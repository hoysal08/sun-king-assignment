Case Study: Scalable Microservices for an E-Commerce Platform
Context:
You are working as a backend developer at a growing e-commerce company. The company has been facing challenges with its current monolithic application due to scalability issues during peak shopping seasons (e.g., Black Friday). The business wants to transition to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, resilience, and maintainability.
Problem:
The current application’s "Order Management System" (OMS) has been identified as a bottleneck. The task is to design and implement a simplified version of the OMS as a microservice. The new service should handle placing orders, updating order statuses, and managing inventory. Additionally, it must be able to handle spikes in traffic gracefully.
Requirements:
1. Order Placement:
   * Accept and process new orders.
   * Validate that enough inventory exists before confirming the order.
   * On order placement, reduce the corresponding inventory count.
2. Order Status Update:
   * Implement an endpoint to update the status of an existing order (e.g., from "Pending" to "Shipped").
3. Inventory Management:
   * Manage inventory counts for different products.
   * Ensure race conditions are handled during concurrent order placements to avoid overselling products.
4. Scalability:
   * Ensure that the service is scalable and can handle traffic spikes (e.g., through queue-based order processing or other mechanisms).
   * Consider a rate-limiting strategy to prevent the system from being overwhelmed during peak hours.
5. Error Handling:
   * Implement robust error handling for scenarios like failed orders, unavailable inventory, etc.
   * Provide meaningful responses and error codes for client applications.
6. Tech Stack:
   * Language - Java.
   * Use an appropriate database (SQL or NoSQL) to handle inventory and order data.
   * Ensure that the system design is extensible for future growth.
Bonus (if time permits):
1. Implement a retry mechanism for failed orders.
2. Integrate a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for processing orders asynchronously to simulate real-world scalability.

Expected Deliverables:
1. A functioning microservice with endpoints for placing orders, updating order status, and managing inventory.
2. Documentation explaining the design, API endpoints, and how to run the service.
3. Optional: Brief explanation of how you’d scale this further in a production environment (e.g., database optimization, horizontal scaling).


1. Postman collection for APIs
2. Github repo
3. DDL of the tables created
